# Machine-Learning-2-Predicting-Airline-Ticket-Prices

Ultimately, our goal is to explore various supervised learning data mining approaches to
uncover solutions to questions revolving around airline ticket prices, allowing us to provide
suggestions to our customers as to where they should fly, when they should fly, and which
airline they should fly with, among many others. We will make sure our customers are getting
the best deal for their personal needs and desires, a promise that will be crucial given todayâ€™s
current state of uncertainty and stress. We hope to bring our customers the best experiences
they deserve and bring the world back together one flight at a time.
